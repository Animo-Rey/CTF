# Zipped Up - MISC[ 70 ]

My friend changed the password of his Minecraft account that I was using so that I would stop being so addicted. Now he wants me to work for the password and sent me this zip file. I tried unzipping the folder, but it just led to another zipped file. Can you find me the password so I can play Minecraft again?

### Solution :
A simple bash script looped a lot did the trick
