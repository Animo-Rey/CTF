We've got a text file which has meaningless characters randomly compiled without line termination. Searching a substring of it will fetch you that it's actually Malbolge, an [Esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language). I decoded the language and got 1's and 0's in `QR.txt`. If you see its makes a QR code with binary numbers where 1's are white and 0's are black. So i wrote a python script to convert it into black and white pixels and generate a `test.png` file. Now you have a QR code image and use any online tool to decode it.
